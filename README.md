# Gilde

Control plane of an AI factory. See `AGENTS.md` for the repository layout and commands.

## Postgres

By default the API uses SQLite (`db.sqlite`). To use Postgres instead:

1. Start Postgres: `docker compose up -d`
2. Set `DATABASE_URL=postgres://gilde:gilde@localhost:5432/gilde` (see `apps/api/.env.example`) and run `pnpm dev`.

## GitHub webhooks (local)

GitHub delivers webhooks to a [smee.io](https://smee.io) channel; the `webhooks` compose service forwards them to the API on your machine. Only webhook deliveries are forwarded, so the API itself stays private.

1. Open https://smee.io, click **Start a new channel**, and put the URL in `.env` as `SMEE_URL` (see `.env.example`).
2. Start the forwarder: `docker compose --profile webhooks up -d` (logs: `docker compose logs -f webhooks`).
3. In the GitHub repo: **Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook**
   - Payload URL: your `SMEE_URL`
   - Content type: `application/json`
   - Secret: the same value as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `apps/api/.env`
   - Events: Pull requests, Check suites, Pull request reviews, Pull request review comments, Issue comments

Anyone with the channel URL can read the payloads, so keep it private; the API's signature check rejects forged deliveries. smee.io is meant for development; for 24/7 operation, run Gilde on a server with its own domain.

## Agent instructions

Routines get their working instructions from [`docs/agent-instructions.md`](docs/agent-instructions.md):
how to read the job payload, branch, test, and format the PR body that Gilde parses
(`gilde-job`, `gilde-run`, the `gilde-result` block and `## Retro`).

For now, paste the file's content into each routine's instructions at claude.ai/code (Routines → edit).
When you change the job payload or the PR body format, update this file in the same PR and re-paste it.
